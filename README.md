### code segments for various network traffic models

#### two-state discrete Markov chain process

------------

- In this code(`two_state_markov_chain.py`), a series of 1's and 0's can be generated based on a transition probability matrix.
- Transition probability matrix can be defined as follows. 

- Markov chain model related to this is illustrated as follows.
